I will share my personal experience with you. \n\nThe pros:\nBob was extremely responsive.  You don't find that kind of customer service anymore in this day and age.  The work done is simply gorgeous. It is MADE IN THE USA.  You get a real life person on the phone every time.  They are excellent communicators!!  \n\nThe cons (if I can even call it that): one of my panels was cut too short.  It is unclear how that happened (fluke in production, someone typed in the wrong measurement?). I got on the phone with Bob, and he had the correct size in production the following day.  I had to pay for shipping, which was not a lot for just 1 panel.  This did push my office remodel back by 1.5 weeks.  But honestly, I was so happy with Bob's personal attention and customer service skills, that I didn't mind too much about the delay.\n\nWainscoting America has their job dialed down to a science. From customer service, to packaging, to shipping, production, etc.  Even with the mishap in size for that one panel, I believe they did an AMAZING job for getting this all done remotely and designing the exact panels that I wished to have without ever entering my property.   Simply put, they are the best at what they do.  I searched far and wide for custom wainscoting - these guys are it!!  \n\nIf you are nervous like I was in the beginning, don't be.  Wainscoting America will hold your hand and help create the beautiful project you have in mind.",

You do need to measure really, really accurately to avoid a lot of trimming, but if you do have to make some adjustments, it's not all that difficult.  I did learn that no matter how straight and flat your walls and floors look, they're not really straight and flat.  There are some installation tricks (like using shims) that you'll learn quickly.  If you do the installation carefully, the seams are invisible; the panels are carefully machined to go together precisely.

Panels installed easily on both level floor and stair slope over the course of two days.  Actually spent more time removing existing trim, finding and marking studs, and a bit of belt sander work to compensate for usual level/plumb problems.  A couple more days of putty, sanding and paint should wrap up the project.  My first thought was to fabricate panels from stock trim and I am so glad I went with Wainscoting America instead.",

And all this was for an order that with shipping that barely totaled $850. My order arrived to NJ in about 2-3 days after placing order, panels are extremely high quality, 4.5\" poplar base molding and cap rail are impeccable furniture quality knot-free wood that is almost a crime for me to be painting, would highly  recommend and will be ordering from them again when I get to my dining room project.

I had ordered the smaller one which is more appropriate for my office, but received the larger one - not a real problem. At least one of the panels is a slightly different height (1/8 inch). Again, not a big problem. All lengths are as ordered. \nPanels came two in box, so each box is a heavy. Difficult for one person, you really need two people. Panels are delivered by a semi-trailer, so plan of unloading on the street.\nI wish they would have sent a couple of scrap HDF pieces for positioning purposes. The HDF cuts really well - no problem trimming the panels. The HDF takes the primer very well - haven't painted yet.\n** Follow-up: Within hours of posting my review I received a call from WA offering to replace the parts. Nice to have great customer service - so I am changing my rating to 5 stars.",

I told them. It was along the back in a few places and they sent me some patch material. It didn’t go through but I was disappointed. The wainscoting was put up and you can’t see anything but that bothers me. The one hole was 1/4 or 3/8 inch deep. I guess I was hoping they would send a new piece but that wasn’t offered. I would normally give them a 5+ but for that damaged piece. Debbie is great to work with. This is a great company",

        "Body": "I worked with Deb to make sure I took the correct dimensions because we had a several windows, doors and outlets/vent covers to cut out. She created the panel sizes for me based on their locations and worked to help me figure out what size panels looked best. She was very responsive and helpful, and after receiving the product and installing it I realize how many details she accounted for that aren’t obvious, so I would definitely recommend working with a consultant rather than just measuring for the panels yourself without help. It doesn’t cost extra. \n\nFrom the time I started the design to the time I received the wainscoting it took under 2 weeks. The delivery guy didn’t even consider hauling the crates up our 3 stairs on the stoop and into the house, so make sure you have someone able to pick it up off your front sidewalk to bring it inside quickly once it is delivered, especially if it is raining. (The boxes are fairly heavy and probably require two people to pick up unless you’re very strong.) I did receive a delivery window to make the timing of this easier. \n\nOnce we received it, we had to trim all but two panels for a perfect fit with a table saw, but that was easy. We also had to cut out the outlet and vent holes with a jigsaw, which was also relatively easy (and they have videos online to help with all of this). We then cut installed the chair rail they provided and our own baseboards and shoe to match the rest of the house. The hardest part was painting/fine grit sanding/painting it, which took 4 coats (1 primer, 3 coats of glossy white) because it soaked into the wood a lot. The end product, however, looks professionally done and I couldn’t be happier with it. \n\nYou probably should be reasonably handy with a saw (or hire someone who is) for install, but you don’t need to have much experience otherwise. The product is truly beautiful.",

The only potential issue was priming the panels for paint.  DO NOT USE Kilz spray primer as the resulting finish is rough with small pimple-like bumps in the routed areas.  Must be the solvents in the spray can.  After a light sanding with 220 grit paper, these disappeared.  The next panel I used Kilz original primer from the can and brush.

Seems its delivered in a 53' semi, which can have difficulty navigating small streets.  I had to meet the driver a mile away, and then load the panels into my SUV, which was just big enough.\n\nOne tip which would have been nice to find on the site, would be to consider ordering the panels 1/4\" shorter than needed, if its part of an inside corner.  That way, if your wall isn't exactly vertical, you can still have the panel fit, and if its a bit short, fill the top of the gap with caulk and no one will know.",

        "Body": "As we were helping my son's family prepare for renovation of their Powder Room, I Googled for examples of powder room design ideas.  Suddenly, I saw a website pop-up for Wainscotingamerica.com.  As soon as I saw the nature of what you do and the panel options, I turned the research over to my husband who has a long history of  construction experience.  After accumulating the room measurements and other details, we contacted a representative, Deb Summa.  She quickly took us through the initial evaluation of our project and presented us with an estimate (including shipping).  From that point forward, we were amazed at how rapidly the process moved!!!  Deb's quick mind and absorption of our room, electrical outlets, recessed TP holder and the desire to center the vanity to the panel design moved the plan from \"drawing board\" status to production!!!!  We  were astounded at the ETA from Deb to the actual real time experience!!!  She was truly a joy and consummate professional . . . fully knowledgeable!!!\nWhen the panels arrived we were immediately thrilled with the quality of the product!!  As the panels were then installed, we continued to be amazed by the precision of EVERYTHING!!!  The project was completed in time for a big family gathering held this past Sunday (July 11th).  Everyone was so impresssed.  We are now making plans to use wainscoting on the stairway from the main floor of my son's home to their finished basement.  We will soon be contacting Deb to take us through that!!!\nIt seems likely there will be several of our friends and relatives contacting you and your website regarding their own project ideas.\nWe are so grateful for the ingenuity and cleverness of your product and the fact we receive such rapid delivery from Conneticut to Indiana!!!\nWe are forever grateful!!!\nFaye Jagger  (Project Manager at my son's home)",

This company offers a very unique product, being able to custom order to fit your space is great, and the instructional videos on measuring are great.  The quality of the router, trim and accessories is excellent, requiring little to no prep work prior to finishing.  Pricing was also comparable to what you would pay to purchase non-customized wainscoting materials off the shelf, or to purchase the raw material and router yourself.  Time, cost and quality were all excellent.  The website was a little tricky, but all it took was a phonecall to figure out how to specify certain things.  Taking accurate measurements is critical and requires some thinking in many cases, so it's not a simple process and easy to get wrong, which of course is on the consumer and not the company, so measure a few times to be sure and pay close attention to the reveal dimensions around doorframes.  In my case everything fit perfectly and I did not fumble any measurements after studying their instructions.  The product looks great, the customer service is top notch and I will definitely do business with again.",

Of course this is MDF wood so I painted it white. (MDF cannot be stained as in wood stain)\n\nYou can't go wrong in dealing with this company. Customer service is helpful, and if you need a status, they actually leave their office chair and go into the manufacturing facility to check provide you a status.\n\nOf course, take your time in measuring for panels, allow for over lays in corners so your trimming will be minimal. Measure, re-measure, and re-measure again and again, before you order. Mark your walls so you know where your panels will stand. View their online vids. Measurements come down to 1/16 of an inch, and the outcome really depends on your measurements. \n\nYes I would use them again.",

        "Body": "I am very pleased with the wainscot panels I ordered. Normally I would custom build all of my own raised and flat panel wainscot or full wall panels but this particular project did not require that custom detail aspect so when I saw that I could order your product made to the sizes we needed for this small room that was going to be painted, I figured that it wouldn't hurt to try it. The panels look great and finished out nicely and most important the client is extremely pleased as am I. I will definitely look to Wainscoting America for any future projects requiring paint grade panels. The only issue I had was the shipper. When they received it at the Dallas trucking distribution center on a Monday they called and set up a delivery time for the next day. When it did not show up in the time frame that was set, I called and they told me that it was at their Salem Illinois center. I called that location and they said that no, it was in Dallas. I then called Bob at your office to let him know what was going on and was very responsive with calling the trucking company and got back to me to let me know they were working on it. So after a couple of days of back and forth delivery was set for Thursday morning between 9:00 and 11:00, at 10:00 I get a call telling me they have a shipment for me that they wanted to set up a delivery time for the next morning, which I then told them no, I will come to their distribution center and pick it up. Luckily the only damage was a small ding in one of the panels that took about 2 minutes to repair with a little glue and a clamp. Sorry to blabber on about the trucking company, maybe they just had a bad week but they certainly seemed to be incompetent and a bit like a bad Three Stooges gig, not your fault. Even my client was surprised because she knows the XPO's CEO. Anyway, long story short, Love your panels and definitely recommend you guys.\nThank you,\nBill Chase\nB & K Chase Construction, Inc.",

We were VERY unhappy with the shipping company and would strongly suggest Wainscoting America finds a new shipping company.",

Without question the most responsive company I have ever dealt with.  \n\nSome things I wish I'd known:\n\nFirst, I measured the walls to within 1/16 of an inch, multiple times and with multiple devices, including laser.   And the panels supplied met with these measurements precisely.  But when put up on a wall and intersecting with the panels on the perpendicular wall, the \"short\" panels were too long by roughly 1/8 inch.  The reason is it is (or so it seems to me) impossible to butt up a panel to a wall so that there is no gap anywhere for the full height.  This apparently is due to the mudding and taping of the drywall.  My house is built of steel studs in steel tracks and 5/8\" drywall, so I did not expect them to be anything but dead-on straight, square, and plumb. Quite wrong.\n\nSecond, I'm noticing wainscot everywhere now, particularly in the movies.  The best ones, the really ornate ones, seem to have recesses but also have a raised perimeter around the recess.  This is not possible with the milling operation that Wainscoting America uses.  This is not to say that the panels are not attractive, because they are.  Just not quite as attractive as those hand-built by a craftsman.\n\nThird, I really wish they would have come already primed.  I would pay extra for that.\n\nAll in all, I am absolutely glad I bought from Wainscoting America and would do it again. We now have the most beautiful dining room around these parts.",

After my initial call with Deb, I knew this is exactly what I wanted.  Because this is done over many phone calls, emails and photos but not in person, Deb was extremely exact to get all the correct dimensions as if something is wrong, it has to be returned.  She calculated exactly how much I needed and how to make it so simple for my contractor to install.  I was unaware that some of the corners to my walls were not joined at 90 degree angles - Duh.  She wanted to know everything.  I want to thank her as she skillfully lead the whole project and even provided links to videos.  My wainscoted walls are so beautifully done that I cannot block them with my furniture.  Thank you DEB.",

From our initial call to this company, speaking with Bob Muckle, we were satisfied that this was a company we wanted to do business with.  The quality of the panels is fantastic.  Beautiful wood. Bob was very helpful, always returned our calls or emails and worked with us to get the drawing/dimensions satisfactorily submitted.  We received our order within 2 weeks of submitting our order.  It was received in good order and I am so excited to get these panels installed in our bathroom remodel. Bob was great to work with and we are so happy we decided to order from Wainscoting America and an opportunity to work with a professional like Bob.",

When I decided I liked the wainscoting panel look, I researched options for what was going to be the best look/easiest to install since I didnt have experience with miter/table saw tools or use. \n\nThe Wainscoting America software designer tool was easy to use and the panels arrived cut perfectly and precisely. One of them arrived damaged but they sent a replacement out the next day with no hassle.\n\nThe hardest part was measuring the angle on the staircase but Deb at the office there helped me / walked me through a couple of the harder cuts. They may be a bit more expensive than getting wood sheets and doing it yourself on a miter saw/table saw set up, but for someone with no experience in that this was a fantastic, super high quality option. \n\nGreat team, especially Deb, and the place looks phenomenal now. Very happy and I highly recommend!",

Things only got better when I eMailed them some questions about a project and Bob Muckle worked with me over the course of a week to refine and custom design the panels for my project, sending multiple CAD drawings (with tolerance down to 1/32\"!).  The panels arrived about a 10 days after ordering (had to ship from the east coast to California) and I was impressed, yet again, by the care in packaging.  Each panel was in a cardboard box, encased in expanding foam so that the panel was fully protected.  The panels themselves are exactly as shown in the CAD drawing and perfect.  I'm SO glad I didn't try making them -- Wainscoting America should be everybody's go-to for wainscoting, trim, baseboard, etc.",

There was only one slight hiccup, which is where the biscuits line up, the top biscuit did not line up and I had to improvise widening the biscuit groove in the MDF, I'm handy so this was no big deal, but for the average \"Joe\" this would have been next to impossible, so be forewarned if you're not handy do not attempt the installation yourself, hire a professional, but overall this is a fantastic product and would buy it again.",

        "Body": "I am 100% satisfied with my wainscot selection. By the way, I learned the proper pronunciation as \"Wayne Scott\" and not \"Wayne's Coat.\" Anyway, my wainscot experience with Wainscoting America began on New Year's Day. Yes, you read right. I called on a federal holiday with hopes of placing a rather difficult order (not difficult to them of course). After placing my order, I rushed to their tutorial websites on how to install, prepare, and paint. My only negative feedback is the low audio quality in their YouTube videos (I am partially deaf, so maybe close captions?). \n\nNonetheless, I found their tutorials spot on! I installed, prepped and painted my wainscot to near perfection (I wished there was a way to load my photos as evidence to this fact). \n\nOnce the panels were installed, I prepped the surface with MH READY PATCH, filled the gaps with caulk, and sanded it all down 220 grit sand paper. After sanding it all down, I primed and painted using Sherwin Williams Super Paint (Ivory, Semi-Gloss). I also used an additive/extender in my paint to allow for better residence time and to minimize brush marks. If you want to avoid brush marks, look up videos on YouTube titled \"paint leveling\" or \"paint extending.\"  Also check out M-1 Latex Paint Additive & Extender to achive a smooth finish.  \n\nOverall, I am thoroughly impressed with Wainscoting America. They produce quality products, have excellent customer service, and provide tutorials for novice DIY'ers like myself.",
