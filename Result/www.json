When the e-tickets did not arrive promptly, sent an email to ask if everything was OK,  in the meantime, multiple checks of the LuxFare website listed my booking as “confirmed”. More than a day later, received an email reply to the effect: So sorry, your booking was never confirmed and will not be ticketed.  A live chat session yielded an admission that there had been a technical glitch, but still tough luck for me.  Due to the elapsed time, my cost for 2 tickets rose more than $300.  Use LuxFares at your peril.",
