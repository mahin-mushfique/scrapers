Completed the project for one room and was so pleased I took on a second project.  The only challenge was in handling a panel at its maximum length as these are made very sturdy and thus pretty heavy (also explains the fairly steep shipping charges)  Customer service was also great in that there was an error with my order and the company responded quickly and worked with me in coming up with a fair/win-win resolution."

These panels worked great.  Just don't look to close at the corners that required miter cuts.  However, caulk and a really good paint can be your friends.

My experience has been incredibly, they know what they are doing & do it well, all the way down to the shipping. When the FedEx arrived I just about told the driver to just take it back & don't waste your time unloading, the pallet was broke in half, & it looked like the boxes on the skid were dropped from the truck several times. As I struggled to open the first & top box, I realized the person or persons who designed the packing method should be commended,  as no damage, the brilliance of packing protecting the delicate corners and arranging panels in such a manner that they would survive the harshes of shipping. Thank you Sam"

2020-07-25,Lorena Zeilman,US,5,Best Customer Service I've Ever Had,"I was hesitant to order from a company I had never heard of in the other side of the country.  I will share my personal experience with you. 

The pros:
Bob was extremely responsive.  You don't find that kind of customer service anymore in this day and age.  The work done is simply gorgeous. It is MADE IN THE USA.  You get a real life person on the phone every time.  They are excellent communicators!!  

The cons (if I can even call it that): one of my panels was cut too short.  It is unclear how that happened (fluke in production, someone typed in the wrong measurement?). I got on the phone with Bob, and he had the correct size in production the following day.  I had to pay for shipping, which was not a lot for just 1 panel.  This did push my office remodel back by 1.5 weeks.  But honestly, I was so happy with Bob's personal attention and customer service skills, that I didn't mind too much about the delay.

Wainscoting America has their job dialed down to a science. From customer service, to packaging, to shipping, production, etc.  Even with the mishap in size for that one panel, I believe they did an AMAZING job for getting this all done remotely and designing the exact panels that I wished to have without ever entering my property.   Simply put, they are the best at what they do.  I searched far and wide for custom wainscoting - these guys are it!!  

If you are nervous like I was in the beginning, don't be.  Wainscoting America will hold your hand and help create the beautiful project you have in mind."

2016-11-08,Kay O.,US,5,"I did it myself, and it looks great!","I measured original wainscoting in my older house and recreated an updated version of it on WA's website for a newly renovated room.  I was worried that I'd make a mistake (I'm not an architect or designer), but I followed the instructions on the website and after a lot of measure-twice, type-once, I submitted my order.  The pieces came on time (the shipping company was supposed to call me with a delivery window, but just showed up, but that's not WA's fault) and they look great installed and painted.  They gave character and warmth to a new construction room so it blended better with the rest of the old house."
2018-04-10,Gary DeBonza,US,5,Amazing,Amazing!  All I did was measure and install.  The real magic was done by the folks at waitscoting america!!!  Only flaw which was worked out was a lift gate was not included in the shipping which comes off my bottom line.
2021-10-05,John Sullivan,US,5,Deb was the best,"Deb was the best. Helped with making sure my measurements where correct, helped sizing panels to accommodate the outlets. Came out perfect."
2018-04-24,Michael Eisele,US,5,I love this product.,"OK, so this was my second project with Wainscoting America.  The on-line design tool is great, the product is first-class and the installation was easy.  You do need to measure really, really accurately to avoid a lot of trimming, but if you do have to make some adjustments, it's not all that difficult.  I did learn that no matter how straight and flat your walls and floors look, they're not really straight and flat.  There are some installation tricks (like using shims) that you'll learn quickly.  If you do the installation carefully, the seams are invisible; the panels are carefully machined to go together precisely.  These people know what they're doing and are happy to help you with your planning - just call them.  I'm a happy customer and already planning a third project."
2022-03-04,Hamilton,US,5,Worth every penny!,"This company was excellent to work with. I went through the website and designed everything myself. This process was a bit cumbersome and ultimately did not pan out. However when I called to speak with them everything changed. Deb took over and designed the whole space, her professionalism and quick responses more than made up for the initial experience trying to do it on my own. This product cut my install time from months to days. It made my life easier and really saved my painter a lot of time. In turn saving my customer money and most importantly, the home owner is blown away."
2019-06-30,Anthony,US,5,Dining room transformation,"Great product, make sure you measure correctly. The wainscoting came in the exact measurements and went up very nicely. Finished it off spraying primer and satin finish top coat. Very happy with the end look.

2021-03-03,Robert Milstead,US,4,Great product but delivery issues.,My order was for four sections of Shaker wainscoting. The quality of the wainscoting is excellent.  And it was well packaged to avoid any shipping damage. The reason I give only four stars is that it took longer to ship and deliver than promised. Understood...the pandemic and recent weather can explain some delay. But I had to call WA once and XLO Logistics twice before getting delivery.

Did a lot of research and YouTube videos, and everyone said you need a 1/2” router table, and Bits. After looking at all the expensive items required to build 2 columns and never use them again seemed like a waste.  I saw all these great reviews, and decided to order them.  Easy ordering, and Bob helped me with the design.
I drove up to Connecticut from Jersey, and picked them up today.  OMG, they came out so GREAT, way better than I imagined.  Met the owner and he showed me the machine making the cuts, great guy, sorry forgot his name, but respected his knowledge and old school workmanship.  Overall it was Less cost and time, and so much better then Any human could do my hand.  Thank You"

It was particularly welcome when they called to check on the exact size I needed (vs. 46"" in stock) then offered to cut the pieces to the 42"" I actually needed.  What a time saver.  The shipping was high, but the materials are heavy.  They aren't installed yet (beadboard and top rails) but I can hardly wait to get them up.

9/4/2019 Update - installed these a few months ago and they look terrific.  It solved a multitude of issues with the lower wall in my 1930's bathroom where I had some plaster issues and took paint beautifully.  This application was bead board and top rails.  I'll consider a fancier application for my downstairs rooms as I get to those."
2017-10-06,Doug S. ,US,5,Excellent product and company,"Excellent product and company.  First off easy to come up with initial design using their web tool.  Then I got loads of help from Bob refining my design.  My order arrived promptly via freight.  Panels were foamed into flat pack boxes so arrived in great shape.  Mill work on panels is nice and crisp. Panels installed easily on both level floor and stair slope over the course of two days.  Actually spent more time removing existing trim, finding and marking studs, and a bit of belt sander work to compensate for usual level/plumb problems.  A couple more days of putty, sanding and paint should wrap up the project.  My first thought was to fabricate panels from stock trim and I am so glad I went with Wainscoting America instead."
2018-05-17,Jose Dumenigo,US,5,Glad to have selected Wainscoting America,"My overall expectations for quality and achieving an elegant look and feel were exceeded due to the well thought out, highly engineered and structured product line (wainscoting, wall panels and approx. 18"" wide tall fluted panels), including their top cap trim and baseboard.   The actual panels look even better than they do online.  In addition, the overall customer experience is excellent - great online design tool, design/dimensional layout help at time of order provided by Bob Muckle, and shipment within 5 days as promised. 

I cannot wait to install wainscoting in our circular staircase and back stairs.  We installed wainscoting in our dining room and wrapped 3x 9 ft columns, 2x 9ft tall fluted fireplace surround panels, a 8ft long bar, and the back side of a 21 ft kitchen island.  The panels were easy to install.  I am an experienced DIY."
2024-02-26,RK,US,5,Quality matters,Wainscoting America personally called to double check the order prior to it being shipped. They have helped me double check my measurements and orders in the past. The products are very high quality and fit nicely.

Stiles were smooth and easy to paint, but machined out sections really suck up the paint.  Suggest company add a paint option.

Just measure where you  want it to go, input the info into their online planning app, wait a few days for delivery (which in my case was across the country,) nail it, paint it and watch your home be transformed beyond what you ever imagined.

They made the wainscot panels and when the panels arrived, all pieces fit like a glove to include all the mitered cuts!  They made my cheap cabinets look like top of the line with minimal cost. Even my contractor of over 30 years was impressed and will be using them for future projects. Thank you Scott and Deb! And did I mention the excellent customer service? They always answered my questions and returned my phone calls expeditiously."

I recommend their product and workmanship without hesitation!"
2020-08-12,David Strock,US,5,Life saver,"I was having an issue matching recessed shadow boxes that were embossed into the drywall from 20 years ago. The dimensions were not the standard of today and the ability to design the panel and sizing was key to making this work.
I recieved the panel i needed in great condition. Only took a few days to get here from time of order. Once installed the customer was thrilled with the finished product. The detail of the box edge wasnt exact but again i was trying to match something from 20 years ago. 
I will definitely be using this company again for future endeavors."
2021-10-06,Randy Catalano,US,4,Product is as advertised and sized exactly as specified,"The product was shipped on a pallet and arrived in perfect condition.  The packaging was very well done although some of the finished panels had spray foam on the finished side.  In the how-to-video it stated that extra pieces of raised panel would be included so that the installer could frame out an electrical box.  It was not included. I've had to plane down some scrap wood to match the 0.320 thickness of the stiles. The product backboard is a bit soft and drilling creates a ragged hole on the back side.

Otherwise the product is as advertised and sized exactly as it was planned."

2016-06-19,Tony Marucci,US,5,"Great service, great product","Scott was the best, after I painstakingly measured and calculated to account for the 5/8"" panel thickness, then wrested with the design of the specialty panel going behind the toilet and sink in our half-bath, I sent the measurements and some pics to Scott, and the next day he emailed me  detailed drawings with panel installation order, different options for the specialty panel, he  incorporatedthe existing HVAC register and electrical outlet, etc. I tortured him with almost daily emails, questions, etc. and every inquiry received a prompt reply or call that day if not within 24 hours.

2020-12-28,Mark Parris,US,5,An excellent product snd experience.,"An excellent product.  Presumes a degree of carpentry and finish carpentry skill.  Design/order process is mostly intuitive and they answer the support line on the first ring if you run into a problem.  Orders come well packaged and mine was in fact shipped within the 5 business days they promise.  No damage in transit.  Wainscotting cuts were accurate to within 1/16th of an inch and slope for staircase pieces was spot on.  Bottom line: if you are confident of your ability to measure accurately and do basic installation this is a great way to save thousands of dollars on a classy, custom look."

Important tip: The primer really sinks into the MDF board so make sure you don’t skimp on the primer. Looks fantastic now that it’s all hung and painted!!!! Highly recommend using."

I would absolutely use the company again and recommend to anyone interested in wainscot.
2021-01-14,Bill Futral,US,5,Minor issues - love the panels,"First, I love the panels - in the middle of installing them now. There were two issues, neither stopped me from going forward. First, they sent the wrong top rail. I had ordered the smaller one which is more appropriate for my office, but received the larger one - not a real problem. At least one of the panels is a slightly different height (1/8 inch). Again, not a big problem. All lengths are as ordered. 
Panels came two in box, so each box is a heavy. Difficult for one person, you really need two people. Panels are delivered by a semi-trailer, so plan of unloading on the street.
I wish they would have sent a couple of scrap HDF pieces for positioning purposes. The HDF cuts really well - no problem trimming the panels. The HDF takes the primer very well - haven't painted yet.
** Follow-up: Within hours of posting my review I received a call from WA offering to replace the parts. Nice to have great customer service - so I am changing my rating to 5 stars."

2019-07-22,Stephen Knitter,US,4,"Perfect, but not quite—4.5","I had a bathroom done with wainscoting from Wainscoting America almost 2 years ago and I couldn’t have been happier. It was absolutely beautiful. I decided to do another bathroom, kitchen and hallway. When the wainscoting came one piece had been damaged on the back by the pallet which had nails sticking out. It was the company’s pallet. I told them. It was along the back in a few places and they sent me some patch material. It didn’t go through but I was disappointed. The wainscoting was put up and you can’t see anything but that bothers me. The one hole was 1/4 or 3/8 inch deep. I guess I was hoping they would send a new piece but that wasn’t offered. I would normally give them a 5+ but for that damaged piece. Debbie is great to work with. This is a great company"

2017-12-27,Natasha D,US,5,Beautiful and reasonably easy to install if you have power saws,"I worked with Deb to make sure I took the correct dimensions because we had a several windows, doors and outlets/vent covers to cut out. She created the panel sizes for me based on their locations and worked to help me figure out what size panels looked best. She was very responsive and helpful, and after receiving the product and installing it I realize how many details she accounted for that aren’t obvious, so I would definitely recommend working with a consultant rather than just measuring for the panels yourself without help. It doesn’t cost extra. 

From the time I started the design to the time I received the wainscoting it took under 2 weeks. The delivery guy didn’t even consider hauling the crates up our 3 stairs on the stoop and into the house, so make sure you have someone able to pick it up off your front sidewalk to bring it inside quickly once it is delivered, especially if it is raining. (The boxes are fairly heavy and probably require two people to pick up unless you’re very strong.) I did receive a delivery window to make the timing of this easier. 

Once we received it, we had to trim all but two panels for a perfect fit with a table saw, but that was easy. We also had to cut out the outlet and vent holes with a jigsaw, which was also relatively easy (and they have videos online to help with all of this). We then cut installed the chair rail they provided and our own baseboards and shoe to match the rest of the house. The hardest part was painting/fine grit sanding/painting it, which took 4 coats (1 primer, 3 coats of glossy white) because it soaked into the wood a lot. The end product, however, looks professionally done and I couldn’t be happier with it. 

You probably should be reasonably handy with a saw (or hire someone who is) for install, but you don’t need to have much experience otherwise. The product is truly beautiful."
2020-12-17,Marcie Prince,US,5,Wonderful Experience and Product,"My experience with Wainscoting America was nothing short of stellar.

2023-08-21,Dave & Jessica K.,US,5,What an amazing company to work with.,"What an amazing company to work with!  We were very skeptical that high quality wainscoting could be milled to our specs and delivered to our door, but Wainscoting America exceeded our every expectation.  We had several complicated features that required extra attention from the staff at the company, who painstakingly worked with us to create a design that was perfect for our setup.  The product received was of the highest quality and our contractor installed it without any problems.  He even started to recommend the company to his other clients.  One word of caution - we thought following the instructions on finishing & painting the wainscoting would be a simple DYI project but it is not for the faint at heart.  Be prepared for some serious work or hire a professional, but the finished product has received so many compliments to date."

2017-03-23,Herman E.,US,4,Overall good product with rapid response.,"Excellent website for ordering raised panels. Size options are great! Overall finish is good with sharp precise cut lines except deepest cut around perimeter of raised panel next to routed curve up to face. This area requires lots of sanding before painting to remove rough finish. I ordered 15 pieces totaling about 60' and one piece was incorrect height dimension: ordered 26 3/4"", received 26 1/4"". Of coarse this was the longest piece at 143"", but I was able to add a 1/2""strip at the bottom rather than return it. Would be nice to get primed or painted panels to better seal the cut edges of the MDF which sponge up the coating."

2024-12-31,Crystal Day-Black,US,5,"Great product, great customer service ", Dining room looks amazing.  I love the wainscoting panels by Wainscoting America. The precision cutting of the panels after several conversations with this company located in Connecticut was a major help. The pallet weighed over 400 pounds and was delivered to my driveway. My contractor needed another railing and I called the company. The customer service was amazing. Deb did a video call so she could discuss the details. I was concerned about the smallest panel being plain. She replaced it with a raised panel after conferring with the contractor via overnight mail. I will be shopping for new dining room furniture this month to reflect my colonial inspired dining room. PS. Thanks HGTV for spotlighting this company in one of their programs.

From the easy of ordering, to the precision of the routing and cutting the materials, and the way it all went together easily...the end result is better than I could have imagined.  The design team and estimating department personnel were extremely knowledgeable and reviewed the panels sizes I input and fixed what could have been cost replacements for me because they were so thorough with the review before fabricating.

2018-09-03,Dennis Oakes,US,5,Great product if you follow instructions,"Ordered the remaining material for the living room.  When ordering shipping via freight was the one question mark in the process.  The material arrived with two boxes broken due to the stapping but with the excellent packing with foam, the panels had no damage.  Installation easy with a pneumatic nail gun.  The only potential issue was priming the panels for paint.  DO NOT USE Kilz spray primer as the resulting finish is rough with small pimple-like bumps in the routed areas.  Must be the solvents in the spray can.  After a light sanding with 220 grit paper, these disappeared.  The next panel I used Kilz original primer from the can and brush.  Much better results and no sanding required."

I was building an extremely detailed custom home which specified a wainscoting system going up the stairway wall switching back and going up another wall.

The company assigned a designer to work with me personally and the entire system was re-designed to make it perfect.

Seems its delivered in a 53' semi, which can have difficulty navigating small streets.  I had to meet the driver a mile away, and then load the panels into my SUV, which was just big enough.

One tip which would have been nice to find on the site, would be to consider ordering the panels 1/4"" shorter than needed, if its part of an inside corner.  That way, if your wall isn't exactly vertical, you can still have the panel fit, and if its a bit short, fill the top of the gap with caulk and no one will know."

2021-07-15,Faye Jagger,US,5,As we were helping my son's family…,"As we were helping my son's family prepare for renovation of their Powder Room, I Googled for examples of powder room design ideas.  Suddenly, I saw a website pop-up for Wainscotingamerica.com.  As soon as I saw the nature of what you do and the panel options, I turned the research over to my husband who has a long history of  construction experience.  After accumulating the room measurements and other details, we contacted a representative, Deb Summa.  She quickly took us through the initial evaluation of our project and presented us with an estimate (including shipping).  From that point forward, we were amazed at how rapidly the process moved!!!  Deb's quick mind and absorption of our room, electrical outlets, recessed TP holder and the desire to center the vanity to the panel design moved the plan from ""drawing board"" status to production!!!!  We  were astounded at the ETA from Deb to the actual real time experience!!!  She was truly a joy and consummate professional . . . fully knowledgeable!!!
When the panels arrived we were immediately thrilled with the quality of the product!!  As the panels were then installed, we continued to be amazed by the precision of EVERYTHING!!!  The project was completed in time for a big family gathering held this past Sunday (July 11th).  Everyone was so impresssed.  We are now making plans to use wainscoting on the stairway from the main floor of my son's home to their finished basement.  We will soon be contacting Deb to take us through that!!!
It seems likely there will be several of our friends and relatives contacting you and your website regarding their own project ideas.
We are so grateful for the ingenuity and cleverness of your product and the fact we receive such rapid delivery from Conneticut to Indiana!!!
We are forever grateful!!!

2016-11-11,Nathan L S.,US,5,"Excellent communication, unique product offering","I received the order in a very timely manner which was expertly packaged and paletted.  This company offers a very unique product, being able to custom order to fit your space is great, and the instructional videos on measuring are great.  The quality of the router, trim and accessories is excellent, requiring little to no prep work prior to finishing.  Pricing was also comparable to what you would pay to purchase non-customized wainscoting materials off the shelf, or to purchase the raw material and router yourself.  Time, cost and quality were all excellent.  The website was a little tricky, but all it took was a phonecall to figure out how to specify certain things.  Taking accurate measurements is critical and requires some thinking in many cases, so it's not a simple process and easy to get wrong, which of course is on the consumer and not the company, so measure a few times to be sure and pay close attention to the reveal dimensions around doorframes.  In my case everything fit perfectly and I did not fumble any measurements after studying their instructions.  The product looks great, the customer service is top notch and I will definitely do business with again."

Scott did an amazing job on the designs, the attention to detail was impeccable. 

I do not live in an area that has a large return on investment of homes due to taxes BUT I am confident that when I try to sell my home I will get asking price due to the differentiation of having a home with Wainscoting.

2016-10-27,Dennis G.,US,5,Great Company To Work With,"I placed 2 orders with them for shipments from CT to FL.
I ordered Wainscoting to do a complete Formal Dining Room, an Entry Foyer, and second order to use for a BreakFeast Bar in the family room, so the panels would match our kitchen.

They custom made  the materials and the job came out great.
In fact, an engineer of homes, and another high end builder GC seen the job and paneling and said, it looks like it actually came with my 25 yo home. Of course this is MDF wood so I painted it white. (MDF cannot be stained as in wood stain)

You can't go wrong in dealing with this company. Customer service is helpful, and if you need a status, they actually leave their office chair and go into the manufacturing facility to check provide you a status.

Of course, take your time in measuring for panels, allow for over lays in corners so your trimming will be minimal. Measure, re-measure, and re-measure again and again, before you order. Mark your walls so you know where your panels will stand. View their online vids. Measurements come down to 1/16 of an inch, and the outcome really depends on your measurements. 

Yes I would use them again."

I am completely satisfied and would recommend Wainscoting America to anyone.
2019-01-25,Bill Chase,US,5,I am very pleased with the wainscot…,"I am very pleased with the wainscot panels I ordered. Normally I would custom build all of my own raised and flat panel wainscot or full wall panels but this particular project did not require that custom detail aspect so when I saw that I could order your product made to the sizes we needed for this small room that was going to be painted, I figured that it wouldn't hurt to try it. The panels look great and finished out nicely and most important the client is extremely pleased as am I. I will definitely look to Wainscoting America for any future projects requiring paint grade panels. The only issue I had was the shipper. When they received it at the Dallas trucking distribution center on a Monday they called and set up a delivery time for the next day. When it did not show up in the time frame that was set, I called and they told me that it was at their Salem Illinois center. I called that location and they said that no, it was in Dallas. I then called Bob at your office to let him know what was going on and was very responsive with calling the trucking company and got back to me to let me know they were working on it. So after a couple of days of back and forth delivery was set for Thursday morning between 9:00 and 11:00, at 10:00 I get a call telling me they have a shipment for me that they wanted to set up a delivery time for the next morning, which I then told them no, I will come to their distribution center and pick it up. Luckily the only damage was a small ding in one of the panels that took about 2 minutes to repair with a little glue and a clamp. Sorry to blabber on about the trucking company, maybe they just had a bad week but they certainly seemed to be incompetent and a bit like a bad Three Stooges gig, not your fault. Even my client was surprised because she knows the XPO's CEO. Anyway, long story short, Love your panels and definitely recommend you guys.
Thank you,

2017-01-15,Stephanie K.,US,5,Excellent quality and craftsmanship.,"We ordered the shaker style wainscoting for our kitchen and was impressed as soon as we opened the box. The wainscoting was thick wood panels, not the cheap particle board you get from some DIY stores, and it looks beautiful on the walls. We are so happy with the results we are planning on doing the living room and dinning room and will absolutely buy from Wainscoting America again!
My one small complaint would be about the shipping company they use.
The shipping company called us on a Wed. and told us they were ready to deliver our wainscoting, however, we were leaving town on Thursday.
We asked if they could deliver the wainscoting later the following week, they said yes but they would charge us a storage fee of $100 a day. 
So we had to rent a truck, drive down to their facilities and pick up the wainscoting early Thursday morning. We were VERY unhappy with the shipping company and would strongly suggest Wainscoting America finds a new shipping company."

In 2016, the home was then elevated and I needed some new pieces to match the old panels. The customer service was excellent. They had my old order, and shipped the new pieces I needed. It matches perfectly. Thank you"
2019-05-12,DRA,US,5,Excellent customer service,"Excellent customer service.  Without question the most responsive company I have ever dealt with.  

Some things I wish I'd known:

First, I measured the walls to within 1/16 of an inch, multiple times and with multiple devices, including laser.   And the panels supplied met with these measurements precisely.  But when put up on a wall and intersecting with the panels on the perpendicular wall, the ""short"" panels were too long by roughly 1/8 inch.  The reason is it is (or so it seems to me) impossible to butt up a panel to a wall so that there is no gap anywhere for the full height.  This apparently is due to the mudding and taping of the drywall.  My house is built of steel studs in steel tracks and 5/8"" drywall, so I did not expect them to be anything but dead-on straight, square, and plumb. Quite wrong.

Second, I'm noticing wainscot everywhere now, particularly in the movies.  The best ones, the really ornate ones, seem to have recesses but also have a raised perimeter around the recess.  This is not possible with the milling operation that Wainscoting America uses.  This is not to say that the panels are not attractive, because they are.  Just not quite as attractive as those hand-built by a craftsman.

Third, I really wish they would have come already primed.  I would pay extra for that.

All in all, I am absolutely glad I bought from Wainscoting America and would do it again. We now have the most beautiful dining room around these parts."

Besides their products being great, their service is the best.  They answer the phone.  They call you to confirm/adjust measurements.

BTW - I never write reviews, that is how good they are."

2022-09-17,Howard Walvick,US,5,Every Comment about Deb is True,"As I read the web comments, I was suspicious as they were too good, but I am very glad to state that happily it all was true.  I was searching for months for wainscoting without any success.  I asked all over and no one was able to help me.  Luckily I found on Google ""Wainscoting America"".  After my initial call with Deb, I knew this is exactly what I wanted.  Because this is done over many phone calls, emails and photos but not in person, Deb was extremely exact to get all the correct dimensions as if something is wrong, it has to be returned.  She calculated exactly how much I needed and how to make it so simple for my contractor to install.  I was unaware that some of the corners to my walls were not joined at 90 degree angles - Duh.  She wanted to know everything.  I want to thank her as she skillfully lead the whole project and even provided links to videos.  My wainscoted walls are so beautifully done that I cannot block them with my furniture.  Thank you DEB."

You need to be careful because most of this stuff you buy from big box stores is very cheaply;made.  After a few years it can warp and the joints don't fit. 

Great product and excellent service."

They showed up very quickly and I was already to install on the Saturday before T-giving. Unfortunately an error was made by the company and one of the panels was made incorrectly. Being a Saturday no one was there and I sent them an email detailing the issue. Much to my surprise I was called about an hour later by Bob who apologized repeatedly and told me they would remake the panel within the hour and get it to FedEx and deliver Monday. While I hated that they had to spend the money air freighting a panel in to me, I appreciated their sense of responsibility. It's a premium product and they understand that service is very much part of the sale. 
It's all installed , looks great , and  I'd put it in again without a doubt."

So one would think the order would ship on the next Friday, which would be 5 business days from placing the order. My order shipped on the Tuesday of the following week. 7 business days from the time I placed my order. 

Also I needed a piece that was 95 inches, so I ordered an piece that was 96 inches. Little did I know, that my mounding would be cut to 94” for shipping. This little tidbit should be made much more obvious to purchasers. Not wanting to splice the moulding, I ended up not using the moulding on my project.

The quality of the product was top notch. Keeping the issues above in mind, I would not hesitate using this company for future needs."

The quality of the materials was very good.  The price paid for the materials was fair.  Unfortunately, the calculation of the angle of rise (stairway) was slightly off, but it is not noticeable enough to be a problem.  My biggest concern is the way that the product was packaged.  The packaging had literally come apart by the time the product was delivered to my home.  Luckily, nothing fell out or was damaged in transit.  They could do a much better job of packaging.  All in all, the finished product looks fantastic!"

Thought the water resistant upgrade was a little expensive as were the panels.
Shipping expensive too.

By the time I primed and painted the panels, I had a sizable investment into them.

All in all, a good product at a high price.  Not sure I will be ordering again."

It might have been handled roughly by Fed Ex. I am sure you guys would not ship it that way. My only suggestion would be to protect the product inside the box a little more robustly. Other than that I was very happy with the panals, measurements were correct, my project is finished and looks great.

Cons. Could be packaged in a crate to reduce damage during shipping.  One panel was discovered with minor damage from a fork truck. Our carpenters agreed the could repair the scratch.

I had tricky spots in my design.  Bob Muckle at Wainscoting America was a great over the phone with recommendations and the final design he worked up for my situation.  

The product was packaged very well and shipped within 4 days of placing the order.

The product itself exceeded expectations.  While produced by CNC, the corners of the raised panels were much sharper and cleaner than expected.  They even cut the slots for and supplied the biscuits for joining the panels together.  

I'm already planning my next wainscoting project and will definitely be placing the order with Wainscoting America."

Recently had a leak in the tub unit which required the replacement of the unit. We had serval contractors come in to bid the renovation. I was amazed that all noticed the wainscoating with a favorable response   Everything from “ now that’s the real deal” to “so where did you buy the wainscoating”. The product after 4 years in the bathroom environment showed no sign of wear.  If you want a great product buy it here. If you want to replace it later go elsewhere.

The only issue I’ve had were a couple of small blemishes where the MDF didn’t quite hold together, but I was able to use it in a non conspicuous area. I would recommend them to others and plan on using them in the future. As a footnote, Bob called promptly and we talked about the small blemish in the trim. He offered to replace it, but I declined because I was able to work around it. And I really am impressed with this company and their product and actually have another order with them.

2020-11-12,Stephanie  F.,US,5,No experience DIY'er - Highly recommend!,"I decided to redo our basement's larger room to be a movie theater, having had zero prior experience doing anything like that. When I decided I liked the wainscoting panel look, I researched options for what was going to be the best look/easiest to install since I didnt have experience with miter/table saw tools or use. 

The Wainscoting America software designer tool was easy to use and the panels arrived cut perfectly and precisely. One of them arrived damaged but they sent a replacement out the next day with no hassle.

The hardest part was measuring the angle on the staircase but Deb at the office there helped me / walked me through a couple of the harder cuts. They may be a bit more expensive than getting wood sheets and doing it yourself on a miter saw/table saw set up, but for someone with no experience in that this was a fantastic, super high quality option. 

Great team, especially Deb, and the place looks phenomenal now. Very happy and I highly recommend!"

The design tool was extremly helpful in not only designing my project but immediately getting a sense for cost (which is a fraction of locally sourced product.)  I was building wainscot panels for the ""legspace"" of a basement bar, and it was important that the panels lined up with where the barstools would be.  It was great to be able to adjust/tweak the stile widths on tbe ends (with relatively standard sized stiles in the middle) on the design tool such that when my contractor came to install, there were no questions or issues.

Turnaround time was excellent as was the packaging.  

An easy 5 star rating!!!!"

2017-01-31,David H.,US,5,"Amazing, Incredible, Fantastic!","I found Wainscoting America through a Google search and was immediately impressed by their website and customization options.  Things only got better when I eMailed them some questions about a project and Bob Muckle worked with me over the course of a week to refine and custom design the panels for my project, sending multiple CAD drawings (with tolerance down to 1/32""!).  The panels arrived about a 10 days after ordering (had to ship from the east coast to California) and I was impressed, yet again, by the care in packaging.  Each panel was in a cardboard box, encased in expanding foam so that the panel was fully protected.  The panels themselves are exactly as shown in the CAD drawing and perfect.  I'm SO glad I didn't try making them -- Wainscoting America should be everybody's go-to for wainscoting, trim, baseboard, etc."

Not to mention the quality of their product’s and the promptness in delivery. One panel and the corner returns were damaged from shipping and I was shipped out and received a new panel/returns in 5 days. My dining room went from blah, plain white walls to a very pretty dining room that fit my taste. Thank you for answering emails, phone calls Deb so quickly.  It was nice to speak to a human when I had to call for a question as I was/am just a beginner in this type of project. Now onto my staircase !! Thanks Wainscoting America. "

2017-10-18,Brian K,US,4,Plain to WOW staircase!,"Ordering this expensive and large item(s), with the consumer / homeowner providing all of the measurements was slightly nerve racking, but the Wainscoting America Technical support Team was very helpful in making certain all of the measurements were spot on and accurate, the panels are now attached to the left and right walls of the staircase and the raised panels look spectacular adding a bit of sophistication to an ordinary flight of stairs to my second floor. There was only one slight hiccup, which is where the biscuits line up, the top biscuit did not line up and I had to improvise widening the biscuit groove in the MDF, I'm handy so this was no big deal, but for the average ""Joe"" this would have been next to impossible, so be forewarned if you're not handy do not attempt the installation yourself, hire a professional, but overall this is a fantastic product and would buy it again."
2016-10-27,Eric Shortt,US,5,First order but definitley not our last,"We found Wainscoting America online in the midst of a powder room remodel.

2016-04-29,Melissa,US,5,Beautiful Wainscoting,We had WasinscotingAmerica wainscoting and beadboard installed all around our condo a few years ago.  The quality of the wainscoting and beadboard is unlike any other I have seen.  When we have friends over they are in awe of how beautiful our place is and how they wished the woodwork in their homes had the quality we have.  The measuring and ordering process was made easy with their great website and awesome customer service.  We can't wait until we buy our first home so that we can add wainscoting to that too!

2017-01-30,Russell Downie,US,5,"Quality Product, Excellent Customer Service!","I am 100% satisfied with my wainscot selection. By the way, I learned the proper pronunciation as ""Wayne Scott"" and not ""Wayne's Coat."" Anyway, my wainscot experience with Wainscoting America began on New Year's Day. Yes, you read right. I called on a federal holiday with hopes of placing a rather difficult order (not difficult to them of course). After placing my order, I rushed to their tutorial websites on how to install, prepare, and paint. My only negative feedback is the low audio quality in their YouTube videos (I am partially deaf, so maybe close captions?). 

Nonetheless, I found their tutorials spot on! I installed, prepped and painted my wainscot to near perfection (I wished there was a way to load my photos as evidence to this fact). 

Once the panels were installed, I prepped the surface with MH READY PATCH, filled the gaps with caulk, and sanded it all down 220 grit sand paper. After sanding it all down, I primed and painted using Sherwin Williams Super Paint (Ivory, Semi-Gloss). I also used an additive/extender in my paint to allow for better residence time and to minimize brush marks. If you want to avoid brush marks, look up videos on YouTube titled ""paint leveling"" or ""paint extending.""  Also check out M-1 Latex Paint Additive & Extender to achive a smooth finish.  

Overall, I am thoroughly impressed with Wainscoting America. They produce quality products, have excellent customer service, and provide tutorials for novice DIY'ers like myself."
